The sender code is in GBN_sender.py and reciever code is in GBN_reciever.py. They can be run using:

python3 GBN_reciever.py <flags>
python3 GBN_sender.py <flags>

<flags>: put the flags required as mentioned in the assignment pdf

Makefile is empty, not needed as I used python
script files are sender.log and reciever.log for sender and reciever respectively.
