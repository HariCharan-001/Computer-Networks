The logic was pretty straight forward but while implementing we have to create a lot of threads.
These lead to race conditions and it took me lot of time to figure out that I was doing a parallel write to a variable.
In the end I learnt a lot from this assignment. 
I learnt the implementation of semaphores (acquire and lock) in python. 
I felt the assignment a bit too much implementation. 
I learnt that it is good to test the code at each step rather than writing everything and testing


Suggestions:
I think the assignment can be modified a bit to reduce the implementation part and focus more on logic
